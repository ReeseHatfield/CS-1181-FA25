# Final Review
The final will be held on **Friday, December 12th at 10:15am in RK 016**. The exam is two hours and will be a paper exam, so a writing utensil is required. The exam is individual and talking will not be tolerated. On the day of your exam, please wait outside the classroom as we will be seating you for the final.

The majority of questions are multiple choices, some short answer, a couple matching, a few fill in the blank, and a few where you will need to write code.

Questions will focus on more recent topics, especially content covered after the midterm, but all topics are fair game.

## Searching/Sorting
* Be able to differentiate between a "good" and "bad" Big O
* Understand which sorting algorithms perform better than others
* Have a basic working understanding of the common sorting algorithms


## Threading
* Understand the difference between start() and run()
* Understand the purpose of join()
* Understand the Thread class and the Runnable interface
* Understand race conditions
* Know when to use synchronized and volatile keywords


## GUI
* Understand basics of animation (Timer, custom graphics, pixel coordinates, etc.)
* Understand basic frame operations
* Understand the difference between JFrame and JPanel
* Understand basic thread usage (EDT, etc.)
* Understand and be able to differentiate between common layout managers
* Understand various ways to implement listeners (separate class, inner class, anonymous inner class, lambda expression)
* Understand benefits of extending JPanel or JComponent


## Recursion
* Be able to write a simple recursive method from a basic explanation
* Be able to read and understand a simple recursive method
* Differentiate between base case and recursive steps
* Understand what happens during a recursive method call
* Have a working understanding of how Java handles method calls, particularly with recursion


## OOP Review, Abstract Classes, Interfaces
You will need to understand the following concepts.

Topics include:
* Inheritance
* Deep vs shallow copies
* Polymorphism
  * Understand the difference between compile and run time
* Abstract classes
  * Can I create an object for an abstract class?
  * What methods need to be implemented by children of an abstract class?
  * Can I inherit more than one abstract class?
* Interfaces
  * Can I implement more than one interface?
  * Understand Comparable interface and how it's used
  * Understand how lambda expressions can be used with certain interfaces
  * Understand dynamic dispatch


## Exceptions

The questions will cover topics like:
* Errors vs Exceptions
* How to write your own Exceptions
* Checked Exceptions


## Generics and Collections
For these questions, you will be expected to:
* Understand the benefits of using generics, especially with ArrayList
* Understand where a generic can be used
* Understand when to extend versus contain a class, specifically ArrayList
* Read/Write a generic class header
* Write a generic method header
* Understand bounded type parameters


## ADTs and Data Structures
You will need to understand the following concepts.

Topics include:
* ADTs
    * Understand what an ADT specifies (or rather DOESN'T specify)
* For all the following, you must be able to understand an example of how the data structure may be used
* Lists
    * Understand code using ArrayLists and LinkedLists
    * Differences between ArrayList and LinkedList implementations
    * Understand how both use memory
    * Understand which is faster/more efficient at which operations
* Stacks and Queues
    * Understand code using Stacks, Queues, and PriorityQueues
    * Understand each's policy for adding/removing items
    * Understand PriorityQueues and how they work (they are not internally sorted!!!)
* Maps and Sets
    * Understand the basics of each of these
